#LegalLensAI

The primary objective of LegalLens AI was to address the critical issue of digital privacy complexity. Many users struggle to understand the intricate and often deliberately obscure language in privacy policies and terms of service. Our project aimed to create an accessible, AI-powered tool that could:
- Demystify complex legal documents
- Provide clear, actionable insights about privacy risks
- Empower users to make informed decisions about their digital privacy
